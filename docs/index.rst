BigML Python Bindings
=====================

`BigML <https://bigml.com>`_ makes machine learning easy by taking care
of the details required to add data-driven decisions and predictive
power to your company. Unlike other machine learning services, BigML
creates
`beautiful predictive models <https://bigml.com/gallery/models>`_ that
can be easily understood and interacted with.

These BigML Python bindings allow you to interact with BigML.io, the API
for BigML. You can use it to easily create, retrieve, list, update, and
delete BigML resources (i.e., sources, datasets, models and,
predictions).

This module is licensed under the `Apache License, Version
2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html>`_.

Support
-------

Please report problems and bugs to our `BigML.io issue
tracker <https://github.com/bigmlcom/io/issues>`_.

Discussions about the different bindings take place in the general
`BigML mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/bigml>`_. Or join us
in our `Campfire chatroom <https://bigmlinc.campfirenow.com/f20a0>`_.

Requirements
------------

Python 2.6 and Python 2.7 are currently supported by these bindings.

The only mandatory third-party dependencies are the
`requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_,
`poster <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/poster/>`_, and `unidecode
<http://http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode/>`_ libraries. These
libraries are automatically installed during the setup.

The bindings will also use ``simplejson`` if you happen to have it
installed, but that is optional: we fall back to Python's built-in JSON
libraries is ``simplejson`` is not found.

Additional `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and
`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ libraries are needed in case you want to use
local predictions for regression models (including the error information)
using proportional missing strategy. As these are quite heavy libraries and
they are so seldom used, they are not included in the automatic installation
dependencies. The test suite includes some tests that will need these
libraries to be installed.

Installation
------------

To install the latest stable release with
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install bigml

You can also install the development version of the bindings directly
from the Git repository::

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/bigmlcom/python.git#egg=bigml_python

Importing the module
--------------------

To import the module::

    import bigml.api

Alternatively you can just import the BigML class::

    from bigml.api import BigML

Authentication
--------------

All the requests to BigML.io must be authenticated using your username
and `API key <https://bigml.com/account/apikey>`_ and are always
transmitted over HTTPS.

This module will look for your username and API key in the environment
variables ``BIGML_USERNAME`` and ``BIGML_API_KEY`` respectively. You can
add the following lines to your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` to set
those variables automatically when you log in::

    export BIGML_USERNAME=myusername
    export BIGML_API_KEY=ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291

With that environment set up, connecting to BigML is a breeze::

    from bigml.api import BigML
    api = BigML()

Otherwise, you can initialize directly when instantiating the BigML
class as follows::

    api = BigML('myusername', 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291')

Also, you can initialize the library to work in the Sandbox
environment by passing the parameter ``dev_mode``::

    api = BigML(dev_mode=True)

Quick Start
-----------

Imagine that you want to use `this csv
file <https://static.bigml.com/csv/iris.csv>`_ containing the `Iris
flower dataset <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set>`_ to
predict the species of a flower whose ``sepal length`` is ``5`` and
whose ``sepal width`` is ``2.5``. A preview of the dataset is shown
below. It has 4 numeric fields: ``sepal length``, ``sepal width``,
``petal length``, ``petal width`` and a categorical field: ``species``.
By default, BigML considers the last field in the dataset as the
objective field (i.e., the field that you want to generate predictions
for).

::

    sepal length,sepal width,petal length,petal width,species
    5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
    4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
    4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
    ...
    5.8,2.7,3.9,1.2,Iris-versicolor
    6.0,2.7,5.1,1.6,Iris-versicolor
    5.4,3.0,4.5,1.5,Iris-versicolor
    ...
    6.8,3.0,5.5,2.1,Iris-virginica
    5.7,2.5,5.0,2.0,Iris-virginica
    5.8,2.8,5.1,2.4,Iris-virginica

You can easily generate a prediction following these steps::

    from bigml.api import BigML

    api = BigML()

    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv')
    dataset = api.create_dataset(source)
    model = api.create_model(dataset)
    prediction = api.create_prediction(model, {'sepal length': 5, 'sepal width': 2.5})

You can then print the prediction using the ``pprint`` method::

    >>> api.pprint(prediction)
    species for {"sepal width": 2.5, "sepal length": 5} is Iris-virginica

and also generate an evaluation for the model by using::

    test_source = api.create_source('./data/test_iris.csv')
    test_dataset = api.create_dataset(test_source)
    evaluation = api.create_evaluation(model, test_dataset)

Setting the ``storage`` argument in the api instantiation::

    api = BigML(storage='./storage')

all the generated, updated or retrieved resources will be automatically
saved to the chosen directory.

Fields
------

BigML automatically generates idenfiers for each field. To see the
fields and the ids and types that have been assigned to a source you can
use ``get_fields``::

    >>> source = api.get_source(source)
    >>> api.pprint(api.get_fields(source))
    {   u'000000': {   u'column_number': 0,
                       u'name': u'sepal length',
                       u'optype': u'numeric'},
        u'000001': {   u'column_number': 1,
                       u'name': u'sepal width',
                       u'optype': u'numeric'},
        u'000002': {   u'column_number': 2,
                       u'name': u'petal length',
                       u'optype': u'numeric'},
        u'000003': {   u'column_number': 3,
                       u'name': u'petal width',
                       u'optype': u'numeric'},
        u'000004': {   u'column_number': 4,
                       u'name': u'species',
                       u'optype': u'categorical'}}

When the number of fields becomes very large, it can be useful to exclude or
filter them. This can be done using a query string expression, for instance::

    >>> source = api.get_source(source, "limit=10&order_by=name")

would include in the retrieved dictionary the first 10 fields sorted by name.

Dataset
-------

If you want to get some basic statistics for each field you can retrieve
the ``fields`` from the dataset as follows to get a dictionary keyed by
field id::

    >>> dataset = api.get_dataset(dataset)
    >>> api.pprint(api.get_fields(dataset))
    {   u'000000': {   u'column_number': 0,
                       u'datatype': u'double',
                       u'name': u'sepal length',
                       u'optype': u'numeric',
                       u'summary': {   u'maximum': 7.9,
                                       u'median': 5.77889,
                                       u'minimum': 4.3,
                                       u'missing_count': 0,
                                       u'population': 150,
                                       u'splits': [   4.51526,
                                                      4.67252,
                                                      4.81113,

                         [... snip ... ]


        u'000004': {   u'column_number': 4,
                       u'datatype': u'string',
                       u'name': u'species',
                       u'optype': u'categorical',
                       u'summary': {   u'categories': [   [   u'Iris-versicolor',
                                                              50],
                                                          [u'Iris-setosa', 50],
                                                          [   u'Iris-virginica',
                                                              50]],
                                       u'missing_count': 0}}}


The field filtering options are also available using a query string expression,
for instance::

    >>> dataset = api.get_dataset(dataset, "limit=20")

limits the number of fields that will be included in ``dataset`` to 20.

Model
-----

One of the greatest things about BigML is that the models that it
generates for you are fully white-boxed. To get the explicit tree-like
predictive model for the example above::

    >>> model = api.get_model(model)
    >>> api.pprint(model['object']['model']['root'])
    {u'children': [
      {u'children': [
        {u'children': [{u'count': 38,
                        u'distribution': [[u'Iris-virginica', 38]],
                        u'output': u'Iris-virginica',
                        u'predicate': {u'field': u'000002',
                        u'operator': u'>',
                        u'value': 5.05}},
                        u'children': [

                            [ ... ]

                           {u'count': 50,
                            u'distribution': [[u'Iris-setosa', 50]],
                            u'output': u'Iris-setosa',
                            u'predicate': {u'field': u'000002',
                                           u'operator': u'<=',
                                           u'value': 2.45}}]},
                        {u'count': 150,
                         u'distribution': [[u'Iris-virginica', 50],
                                           [u'Iris-versicolor', 50],
                                           [u'Iris-setosa', 50]],
                         u'output': u'Iris-virginica',
                         u'predicate': True}]}}}

(Note that we have abbreviated the output in the snippet above for
readability: the full predictive model you'll get is going to contain
much more details).

Again, filtering options are also available using a query string expression,
for instance::

    >>> model = api.get_model(model, "limit=5")

limits the number of fields that will be included in ``model`` to 5.

Evaluation
----------

The predictive performance of a model can be measured using many different
measures. In BigML these measures can be obtained by creating evaluations. To
create an evaluation you need the id of the model you are evaluating and the id
of the dataset that contains the data to be tested with. The result is shown
as::

    >>> evaluation = api.get_evaluation(evaluation)
    >>> api.pprint(evaluation['object']['result'])
    {   'class_names': ['0', '1'],
        'mode': {   'accuracy': 0.9802,

                                                      'recall': 0.038461538461538464}]}}

where two levels of detail are easily identified. For classifications,
the first level shows these keys:

-  **class_names**: A list with the names of all the categories for the objective field (i.e., all the classes)    
-  **mode**: A detailed result object. Measures of the performance of the classifier that predicts the mode class for all the instances in the dataset
-  **model**: A detailed result object.
-  **random**: A detailed result object.  Measures the performance of the classifier that predicts a random class for all the instances in the dataset.

and the detailed result objects include ``accuracy``, ``average_f_measure``, ``average_phi``,
``average_precision``, ``average_recall``, ``confusion_matrix``
and ``per_class_statistics``.

For regressions first level will contain these keys:

-  **mean**: A detailed result object. Measures the performance of the model that predicts the mean for all the instances in the dataset.
-  **model**: A detailed result object.
-  **random**: A detailed result object. Measures the performance of the model that predicts a random class for all the instances in the dataset.

where the detailed result objects include ``mean_absolute_error``,
``mean_squared_error`` and ``r_squared`` (refer to
`developers documentation <https://bigml.com/developers/evaluations>`_ for
more info on the meaning of these measures.


Creating Resources
------------------

Newly-created resources are returned in a dictionary with the following
keys:

-  **code**: If the request is successful you will get a
   ``bigml.api.HTTP_CREATED`` (201) status code. In asynchronous file uploading
   ``api.create_source`` calls, it will contain ``bigml.api.HTTP_ACCEPTED`` (202)
   status code. Otherwise, it will be
   one of the standard HTTP error codes `detailed in the
   documentation <https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>`_.
-  **resource**: The identifier of the new resource.
-  **location**: The location of the new resource.
-  **object**: The resource itself, as computed by BigML.
-  **error**: If an error occurs and the resource cannot be created, it
   will contain an additional code and a description of the error. In
   this case, **location**, and **resource** will be ``None``.

Statuses
~~~~~~~~

Please, bear in mind that resource creation is almost always
asynchronous (**predictions** are the only exception). Therefore, when
you create a new source, a new dataset or a new model, even if you
receive an immediate response from the BigML servers, the full creation
of the resource can take from a few seconds to a few days, depending on
the size of the resource and BigML's load. A resource is not fully
created until its status is ``bigml.api.FINISHED``. See the
`documentation on status
codes <https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>`_ for the listing of
potential states and their semantics. So depending on your application
you might need to import the following constants::

    from bigml.api import WAITING
    from bigml.api import QUEUED
    from bigml.api import STARTED
    from bigml.api import IN_PROGRESS
    from bigml.api import SUMMARIZED
    from bigml.api import FINISHED
    from bigml.api import UPLOADING
    from bigml.api import FAULTY
    from bigml.api import UNKNOWN
    from bigml.api import RUNNABLE

You can query the status of any resource with the ``status`` method::

    api.status(source)
    api.status(dataset)
    api.status(model)
    api.status(prediction)
    api.status(evaluation)
    api.status(ensemble)
    api.status(batch_prediction)

Before invoking the creation of a new resource, the library checks that
the status of the resource that is passed as a parameter is
``FINISHED``. You can change how often the status will be checked with
the ``wait_time`` argument. By default, it is set to 3 seconds.

You can also use the ``check_resource`` function::

    check_resource(resource, api.get_source)

that will constantly query the API until the resource gets to a FINISHED or
FAULTY state, or can also be used with ``wait_time`` and ``retries``
arguments to control the pulling::

    check_resource(resource, api.get_source, wait_time=2, retries=20)

The ``wait_time`` value is used as seed to a wait
interval that grows exponentially with the number of retries up to the given
``retries`` limit.

Creating sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a source from a local data file, you can use the
``create_source`` method. The only required parameter is the path to the
data file (or file-like object). You can use a second optional parameter
to specify any of the
options for source creation described in the `BigML API
documentation <https://bigml.com/developers/sources>`_.

Here's a sample invocation::

    from bigml.api import BigML
    api = BigML()

    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv',
        {'name': 'my source', 'source_parser': {'missing_tokens': ['?']}})

or you may want to create a source from a file in a remote location::

    source = api.create_source('s3://bigml-public/csv/iris.csv',
        {'name': 'my remote source', 'source_parser': {'missing_tokens': ['?']}})

or maybe reading the content from stdin::

    content = StringIO.StringIO(sys.stdin.read())
    source = api.create_source(content,
        {'name': 'my stdin source', 'source_parser': {'missing_tokens': ['?']}})

As already mentioned, source creation is asynchronous. In both these examples,
the ``api.create_source`` call returns once the file is uploaded.
Then ``source`` will contain a resource whose status code will be either
``WAITING`` or ``QUEUED``.

For local data files you can go one step further and use asynchronous
uploading::

    source = api.create_source('./data/iris.csv',
        {'name': 'my source', 'source_parser': {'missing_tokens': ['?']}},
        async=True)

In this case, the call fills `source` immediately with a primary resource like::

    {'code': 202,
     'resource': None,
     'location': None,
     'object': {'status':
                   {'progress': 0.99,
                    'message': 'The upload is in progress',
                    'code': 6}},
     'error': None}

where the ``source['object']`` status is set to ``UPLOADING`` and  its
``progress`` is periodically updated with the current uploading
progress ranging from 0 to 1. When upload completes, this structure will be
replaced by the real resource info as computed by BigML. Therefore source's
status will eventually be (as it is in the synchronous upload case)
``WAITING`` or ``QUEUED``.

You can retrieve the updated status at any time using the corresponding get
method. For example, to get the status of our source we would use::

    api.status(source)

Creating datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have created a source, you can create a dataset. The only
required argument to create a dataset is a source id. You can add all
the additional arguments accepted by BigML and documented in the
`Datasets section of the Developer's
documentation <https://bigml.com/developers/datasets>`_.

For example, to create a dataset named "my dataset" with the first 1024
bytes of a source, you can submit the following request::

    dataset = api.create_dataset(source, {"name": "my dataset", "size": 1024})

Upon success, the dataset creation job will be queued for execution, and
you can follow its evolution using ``api.status(dataset)``.

You can also extract samples from an existing dataset and generate a new one
with them using the ``api.create_dataset`` method. The first argument should
be the origin dataset and the rest of arguments that set the range or the
sampling rate should be passed as a dictionary. For instance, to create a new
dataset extracting the 80% of instances from an existing one, you could use::

    dataset = api.create_dataset(origin_dataset, {"sample_rate": 0.8})

Creating models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have created a dataset, you can create a model. The only
required argument to create a model is a dataset id. You can also
include in the request all the additional arguments accepted by BigML
and documented in the `Models section of the Developer's
documentation <https://bigml.com/developers/models>`_.

For example, to create a model only including the first two fields and
the first 10 instances in the dataset, you can use the following
invocation::

    model = api.create_model(dataset, {
        "name": "my model", "input_fields": ["000000", "000001"], "range": [1, 10]})

Again, the model is scheduled for creation, and you can retrieve its
status at any time by means of ``api.status(model)`` .

Creating predictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now use the model resource identifier together with some input
parameters to ask for predictions, using the ``create_prediction``
method. You can also give the prediction a name::

    prediction = api.create_prediction(model,
                                       {"sepal length": 5,
                                        "sepal width": 2.5},
                                        {"name": "my prediction"})

To see the prediction you can use ``pprint``::

    api.pprint(prediction)

Creating evaluations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have created a model, you can measure its perfomance by running a
dataset of test data through it and comparing its predictions to the objective
field real values. Thus, the required arguments to create an evaluation are
model id and a dataset id. You can also
include in the request all the additional arguments accepted by BigML
and documented in the `Evaluations section of the Developer's
documentation <https://bigml.com/developers/evaluations>`_.

For instance, to evaluate a previously created model using at most 10000 rows
from an existing dataset
you can use the following call::

    evaluation = api.create_evaluation(model, dataset, {
        "name": "my model", "max_rows": 10000})

Again, the evaluation is scheduled for creation and ``api.status(evaluation)``
will show its state.

Evaluations can also check the ensembles' performance. To evaluate an ensemble
you can do exactly what we just did for the model case, using the ensemble
object instead of the model as first argument::

    evaluation = api.create_evaluation(ensemble, dataset)

Creating ensembles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve the performance of your predictions, you can create an ensemble
of models and combine their individual predictions.
The only required argument to create an ensemble is the dataset id::

    ensemble = api.create_ensemble('dataset/5143a51a37203f2cf7000972')

but you can also specify the number of models to be built and the
parallelism level for the task::

    args = {'number_of_models': 20, 'tlp': 3}
    ensemble = api.create_ensemble('dataset/5143a51a37203f2cf7000972', args)

``tlp`` (task-level parallelism) should be an integer between 1 and 5 (the 
number of models to be built in parallel). A higher ``tlp`` results in faster
ensemble creation, but it will consume more credits. The default value for
``number_of_models`` is 10 and for ``tlp`` is 1.

Creating batch predictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have shown how to create predictions individually, but when the amount
of predictions to make increases, this procedure is far from optimal. In this
case, the more efficient way of predicting remotely is to create a dataset
containing the input data you want your model to predict from and to give its
id and the one of the model to the ``create_batch_prediction`` api call::

    batch_prediction = api.create_batch_prediction(model, dataset, {
        "name": "my batch prediction", "all_fields": True,
        "header": True,
        "confidence": True})

In this example, setting ``all_fields`` to true causes the input
data to be included in the prediction output, ``header`` controls whether a
headers line is included in the file or not and ``confidence`` set to true
causes the confidence of the prediction to be appended. If none of these
arguments is given, the resulting file will contain the name of the
objective field as a header row followed by the predictions.

As for the rest of resources, the create method will return an incomplete
object, that can be updated by issuing the corresponding
``api.get_batch_prediction`` call until it reaches a ``FINISHED`` status.
Then you can download the created predictions file using::

    api.download_batch_prediction('batchprediction/526fc344035d071ea3031d70',
        filename='my_dir/my_predictions.csv')

that will copy the output predictions to the local file given in
``filename``. If no ``filename`` is provided, the method returns a file-like
object that can be read as a stream::

    CHUNK_SIZE = 1024
    response = api.download_batch_prediction(
        'batchprediction/526fc344035d071ea3031d70')
    chunk = response.read(CHUNK_SIZE)
    if chunk:
        print chunk


Reading Resources
-----------------

When retrieved individually, resources are returned as a dictionary
identical to the one you get when you create a new resource. However,
the status code will be ``bigml.api.HTTP_OK`` if the resource can be
retrieved without problems, or one of the HTTP standard error codes
otherwise.

Listing Resources
-----------------

You can list resources with the appropriate api method::

    api.list_sources()
    api.list_datasets()
    api.list_models()
    api.list_predictions()
    api.list_evaluations()
    api.list_ensembles()
    api.list_batch_predictions()

you will receive a dictionary with the following keys:

-  **code**: If the request is successful you will get a
   ``bigml.api.HTTP_OK`` (200) status code. Otherwise, it will be one of
   the standard HTTP error codes. See `BigML documentation on status
   codes <https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>`_ for more info.
-  **meta**: A dictionary including the following keys that can help you
   paginate listings:

   -  **previous**: Path to get the previous page or ``None`` if there
      is no previous page.
   -  **next**: Path to get the next page or ``None`` if there is no
      next page.
   -  **offset**: How far off from the first entry in the resources is
      the first one listed in the resources key.
   -  **limit**: Maximum number of resources that you will get listed in
      the resources key.
   -  **total\_count**: The total number of resources in BigML.

-  **objects**: A list of resources as returned by BigML.
-  **error**: If an error occurs and the resource cannot be created, it
   will contain an additional code and a description of the error. In
   this case, **meta**, and **resources** will be ``None``.

Filtering Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter resources in listings using the syntax and fields labeled
as *filterable* in the `BigML
documentation <https://bigml.com/developers>`_ for each resource.

A few examples:

Ids of the first 5 sources created before April 1st, 2012
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [source['resource'] for source in
      api.list_sources("limit=5;created__lt=2012-04-1")['objects']]

Name of the first 10 datasets bigger than 1MB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [dataset['name'] for dataset in
      api.list_datasets("limit=10;size__gt=1048576")['objects']]

Name of models with more than 5 fields (columns)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [model['name'] for model in api.list_models("columns__gt=5")['objects']]

Ids of predictions whose model has not been deleted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [prediction['resource'] for prediction in
      api.list_predictions("model_status=true")['objects']]

Ordering Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can order resources in listings using the syntax and fields labeled
as *sortable* in the `BigML
documentation <https://bigml.com/developers>`_ for each resource.

A few examples:

Name of sources ordered by size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [source['name'] for source in api.list_sources("order_by=size")['objects']]

Number of instances in datasets created before April 1st, 2012 ordered by size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [dataset['rows'] for dataset in
      api.list_datasets("created__lt=2012-04-1;order_by=size")['objects']]

Model ids ordered by number of predictions (in descending order).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [model['resource'] for model in
      api.list_models("order_by=-number_of_predictions")['objects']]

Name of predictions ordered by name.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [prediction['name'] for prediction in
      api.list_predictions("order_by=name")['objects']]

Updating Resources
------------------

When you update a resource, it is returned in a dictionary exactly like
the one you get when you create a new one. However the status code will
be ``bigml.api.HTTP_ACCEPTED`` if the resource can be updated without
problems or one of the HTTP standard error codes otherwise.

::

    api.update_source(source, {"name": "new name"})
    api.update_dataset(dataset, {"name": "new name"})
    api.update_model(model, {"name": "new name"})
    api.update_prediction(prediction, {"name": "new name"})
    api.update_evaluation(evaluation, {"name": "new name"})
    api.update_ensemble(ensemble, {"name": "new name"})
    api.update_batch_prediction(batch_prediction, {"name": "new name"})

Updates can change resource general properties, such as the ``name`` or
``description`` attributes of a dataset, or specific properties. As an example,
let's say that your source has a certain field whose contents are
numeric integers. BigML will assign a numeric type to the field, but you
might want it to be used as a categorical field. You could change
its type to ``categorical`` by calling::

    api.update_source(source, {"fields": {"000001": {"optype": "categorical"}}})

where ``000001`` is the field id that corresponds to the updated field.
You will find detailed information about
the updatable attributes of each resource in
`BigML developer's documentation <https://bigml.com/developers>`_.

Deleting Resources
------------------

Resources can be deleted individually using the corresponding method for
each type of resource.

::

    api.delete_source(source)
    api.delete_dataset(dataset)
    api.delete_model(model)
    api.delete_prediction(prediction)
    api.delete_evaluation(evaluation)
    api.delete_ensemble(ensemble)
    api.delete_batch_prediction(batch_prediction)

Each of the calls above will return a dictionary with the following
keys:

-  **code** If the request is successful, the code will be a
   ``bigml.api.HTTP_NO_CONTENT`` (204) status code. Otherwise, it wil be
   one of the standard HTTP error codes. See the `documentation on
   status codes <https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>`_ for more
   info.
-  **error** If the request does not succeed, it will contain a
   dictionary with an error code and a message. It will be ``None``
   otherwise.

Public and shared resources
---------------------------

The previous examples use resources that were created by the same user
that asks for their retrieval or modification. If a user wants to share one
of her resources, she can make them public or share them. Declaring a resource
public means that anyone can see the resource. This can be applied to datasets
and models. To turn a dataset public, just update its ``private`` property::

    api.update_dataset('dataset/5143a51a37203f2cf7000972', {'private': false})

and any user will be able to download it using its id prepended by ``public``::

    api.get_dataset('public/dataset/5143a51a37203f2cf7000972')

In the models' case, you can also choose if you want the model to be fully
downloadable or just accesible to make predictions. This is controlled with the
``white_box`` property. If you want to publish your model completely, just
use::

    api.update_model('model/5143a51a37203f2cf7000956', {'private': false,
                     'white_box': true})

Both public models and datasets, will be openly accessible for anyone,
registered or not, from the web
gallery.

Still, you may want to share your models with other users, but without making
them public for everyone. This can be achieved by setting the ``shared``
property::

    api.update_model('model/5143a51a37203f2cf7000956', {'shared': true})

Shared models can be accessed using their share hash (propery ``shared_hash``
in the original model)::

    api.get_model('shared/model/d53iw39euTdjsgesj7382ufhwnD')

or by using their original id with the creator user as username and a specific
sharing api_key you will find as property ``sharing_api_key`` in the updated
model::

    api.get_model('model/5143a51a37203f2cf7000956', shared_username='creator',
                  shared_api_key='c972018dc5f2789e65c74ba3170fda31d02e00c3')

Only users with the share link or credentials information will be able to
access your shared models.

Local Models
------------

You can instantiate a local version of a remote model.

::

   from bigml.api import BigML
   from bigml.model import Model

   api = BigML()

   # Use the model/id of one of your models
   model = api.get_model('model/502fdbff1552687661000261')

   local_model = Model(model)

This will return a Model object that you can use to make local predictions,
generate IF-THEN rules or a Python function that implements the model.

Beware of using filtered fields models to instantiate a local model. The local
model methods need the important fields in the ``model`` parameter to be
available. If an important field is missing (because it has been excluded or
filtered), an exception will arise.

Local Predictions
-----------------

Once you have a local model you can use to generate predictions locally.

::

    local_model.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1})
    petal length > 2.45 AND petal width <= 1.65 AND petal length <= 4.95 =>
    Iris-versicolor

Local predictions have three clear advantages:

- Removing the dependency from BigML to make new predictions.

- No cost (i.e., you do not spend BigML credits).

- Extremely low latency to generate predictions for huge volumes of data.


Multi Models
------------

Multi Models use a numbers of BigML remote models to build a local version
that can be used to generate predictions locally. Predictions are generated
combining the outputs of each model.

::

    from bigml.api import BigML
    from bigml.multimodel import MultiModel

    api = BigML()

    model = MultiModel([api.get_model(model['resource']) for model in
                       api.list_models(query_string="tags__in=my_tag")
                       ['objects']])

    model.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1})

This will create a multi model using all the models that have been previously
tagged with ``my_tag`` and predict by combining each model's prediction.
The combination method used by default is ``plurality`` for categorical
predictions and mean value for numerical ones. You can also use ``confidence
weighted``::

    model.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1}, method=1)

that will weight each vote using the confidence/error given by the model
to each prediction, or even ``probability weighted``::

    model.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1}, method=2)

that weights each vote by using the probability associated to the training
distribution at the prediction node.

There's also a ``threshold`` method that uses an additional set of options:
threshold and category. The category is predicted if and only if
the number of predictions for that category is at least the threshold value.
Otherwise, the prediction is plurality for the rest of predicted values.

An example of ``threshold`` combination method would be::

    model.predict({'petal length': 0.9, 'petal width': 3.0}, method=3,
                  options={'threshold': 3, 'category': 'Iris-virginica'})


When making predictions on a test set with a large number of models,
``batch_predict`` can be useful to log each model's predictions in a
separated file. It expects a list of input data values and the directory path
to save the prediction files in.

::

    model.batch_predict([{"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1},
                         {"petal length": 1, "petal width": 5.1}],
                        "data/predictions")

The predictions generated for each model will be stored in an output
file in `data/predictions` using the syntax
`model_[id of the model]__predictions.csv`. For instance, when using
`model/50c0de043b563519830001c2` to predict, the output file name will be
`model_50c0de043b563519830001c2__predictions.csv`. An additional feature is
that using ``reuse=True`` as argument will force the function to skip the
creation of the file if it already exists. This can be
helpful when using repeatedly a bunch of models on the same test set.

::

    model.batch_predict([{"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1},
                         {"petal length": 1, "petal width": 5.1}],
                        "data/predictions", reuse=True)

Prediction files can be subsequently retrieved and converted into a votes list
using ``batch_votes``::

    model.batch_votes("data/predictions")

which will return a list of MultiVote objects. Each MultiVote contains a list
of predictions (e.g. ``[{'prediction': u'Iris-versicolor', 'confidence': 0.34,
'order': 0}, {'prediction': u'Iris-setosa', 'confidence': 0.25,
'order': 1}]``).
These votes can be further combined to issue a final
prediction for each input data element using the method ``combine``

::

    for multivote in model.batch_votes("data/predictions"):
        prediction = multivote.combine()

Again, the default method of combination is ``plurality`` for categorical
predictions and mean value for numerical ones. You can also use ``confidence
weighted``::

    prediction = multivote.combine(1)

or ``probability weighted``::

    prediction = multivote.combine(2)

You can also get a confidence measure for the combined prediction::

    prediction = multivolte.combine(0, with_confidence=True)

For classification, the confidence associated to the combined prediction
is derived by first selecting the model's predictions that voted for the
resulting prediction and computing the weighted average of their individual
confidence. Nevertheless, when ``probability weighted`` is used,
the confidence is obtained by using each model's distribution at the
prediction node to build a probability distribution and combining them.
The confidence is then computed as the wilson score interval of the
combined distribution (using as total number of instances the sum of all
the model's distributions original instances at the prediction node)

In regression, all the models predictions' confidences contribute
to the weighted average confidence.


Ensembles
---------

Remote ensembles can also be used locally through the ``Ensemble``
class. The simplest way to access an existing ensemble and using it to
predict locally is::

    from bigml.ensemble import Ensemble
    ensemble = Ensemble('ensemble/5143a51a37203f2cf7020351')
    ensemble.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1})

This call will download all the ensemble related info and store it in a
``./storage`` directory ready to be used to predict. As in
``MultipleModel``, several prediction combination methods are available, and
you can choose another storage directory or even avoid storing at all, for
instance::

    from bigml.api import BigML
    from bigml.ensemble import Ensemble

    # api connection
    api = BigML(storage='./my_storage')

    # creating ensemble
    ensemble = api.create_ensemble('dataset/5143a51a37203f2cf7000972')

    # Ensemble object to predict
    ensemble = Ensemble(ensemble, api)
    ensemble.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1}, method=1)

creates a new ensemble and stores its information in ``./my_storage``
folder. Then this information is used to predict locally using the
``confidence weighted`` method.

Similarly, local ensembles can also be created by giving a list of models to be
combined to issue the final prediction::

    from bigml.ensemble import Ensemble
    ensemble = Ensemble(['model/50c0de043b563519830001c2',
                         'model/50c0de043b5635198300031b')]
    ensemble.predict({"petal length": 3, "petal width": 1})


Fields
------

Once you have a resource you can use the ``Fields`` class to generate a
representation that will allow you to easily list fields, get fields ids, get a
field id by name, column number, etc.

::

    from bigml.fields import Fields

    fields = Fields(source['object']['fields'])

    # Internal id of the 'sepal length' field
    fields.field_id('sepal length')

    # Field name of field with column number 0
    fields.field_name(0)

    # Column number of field name 'petal length'
    fields.field_column_number('petal length')

You can also easily ``pair`` a list of values with fields ids what is very
useful to make predictions.

For example, the following snippet may be useful to create local predictions using
a csv file as input::

    test_reader = csv.reader(open(dir + test_set))
    local_model = Model(model)
    for row in test_reader:
        input_data = fields.pair([float(val) for val in row], objective_field)
        prediction = local_model.predict(input_data, by_name=False)

If missing values are present, the ``Fields`` object can return a dict
with the ids of the fields that contain missing values and its count. The
following example::

    from bigml.fields import Fields

    fields = Fields(dataset['object']['fields'])
    fields.missing_counts()

would output::

    {'000003': 1, '000000': 1, '000001': 1}

if the there was a missing value in each of the fields whose ids are
``000003``, ``000000``, ``000001``. 

You can also obtain the counts of errors per field using the ``errors_count``
method of the api::

    from bigml.api import BigML
    api = BigML()
    dataset = api.get_dataset("dataset/5339d42337203f233e000015")
    api.error_counts(dataset)

The generated output is like the one in ``missing_counts``, that is, the error
counts per field::

{'000000': 1}


Rule Generation
---------------

You can also use a local model to generate a IF-THEN rule set that can be very
helpful to understand how the model works internally.

::

     local_model.rules()
     IF petal_length > 2.45 AND
         IF petal_width > 1.65 AND
             IF petal_length > 5.05 THEN
                 species = Iris-virginica
             IF petal_length <= 5.05 AND
                 IF sepal_width > 2.9 AND
                     IF sepal_length > 5.95 AND
                         IF petal_length > 4.95 THEN
                             species = Iris-versicolor
                         IF petal_length <= 4.95 THEN
                             species = Iris-virginica
                     IF sepal_length <= 5.95 THEN
                         species = Iris-versicolor
                 IF sepal_width <= 2.9 THEN
                     species = Iris-virginica
         IF petal_width <= 1.65 AND
             IF petal_length > 4.95 AND
                 IF sepal_length > 6.05 THEN
                     species = Iris-virginica
                 IF sepal_length <= 6.05 AND
                     IF sepal_width > 2.45 THEN
                         species = Iris-versicolor
                     IF sepal_width <= 2.45 THEN
                         species = Iris-virginica
             IF petal_length <= 4.95 THEN
                 species = Iris-versicolor
     IF petal_length <= 2.45 THEN
         species = Iris-setosa


Python, Tableau and Hadoop-ready Generation
-------------------------------------------

If you prefer, you can also generate a Python function that implements the model
and that can be useful to make the model actionable right away with ``local_model.python()``.

::

    local_model.python()
    def predict_species(sepal_length=None,
                        sepal_width=None,
                        petal_length=None,
                        petal_width=None):
        """ Predictor for species from model/50a8e2d9eabcb404d2000293

            Predictive model by BigML - Machine Learning Made Easy
        """
        if (petal_length is None):
            return 'Iris-virginica'
        if (petal_length <= 2.45):
            return 'Iris-setosa'
        if (petal_length > 2.45):
            if (petal_width is None):
                return 'Iris-virginica'
            if (petal_width <= 1.65):
                if (petal_length <= 4.95):
                    return 'Iris-versicolor'
                if (petal_length > 4.95):
                    if (sepal_length is None):
                        return 'Iris-virginica'
                    if (sepal_length <= 6.05):
                        if (petal_width <= 1.55):
                            return 'Iris-virginica'
                        if (petal_width > 1.55):
                            return 'Iris-versicolor'
                    if (sepal_length > 6.05):
                        return 'Iris-virginica'
            if (petal_width > 1.65):
                if (petal_length <= 5.05):
                    if (sepal_width is None):
                        return 'Iris-virginica'
                    if (sepal_width <= 2.9):
                        return 'Iris-virginica'
                    if (sepal_width > 2.9):
                        if (sepal_length is None):
                            return 'Iris-virginica'
                        if (sepal_length <= 6.4):
                            if (sepal_length <= 5.95):
                                return 'Iris-versicolor'
                            if (sepal_length > 5.95):
                                return 'Iris-virginica'
                        if (sepal_length > 6.4):
                            return 'Iris-versicolor'
                if (petal_length > 5.05):
                    return 'Iris-virginica'

The ``local.python(hadoop=True)`` call will generate the code that you need
for the Hadoop map-reduce engine to produce batch predictions using `Hadoop
streaming <http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.15.2/streaming.html>`_ .
Saving the mapper and reducer generated functions in their corresponding files
(let's say ``/home/hduser/hadoop_mapper.py`` and
``/home/hduser/hadoop_reducer.py``) you can start a Hadoop job
to generate predictions by issuing
the following Hadoop command in your system console:

::

    bin/hadoop jar contrib/streaming/hadoop-*streaming*.jar \
    -file /home/hduser/hadoop_mapper.py -mapper hadoop_mapper.py \
    -file /home/hduser/hadoop_reducer.py -reducer hadoop_reducer.py \
    -input /home/hduser/hadoop/input.csv \
    -output /home/hduser/hadoop/output_dir

assuming you are in the Hadoop home directory, your input file is in the
corresponding dfs directory
(``/home/hduser/hadoop/input.csv`` in this example) and the output will
be placed at ``/home/hduser/hadoop/output_dir`` (inside the dfs directory).

Tableau-ready rules are also available through ``local_model.tableau()`` for
all the models except those that use text predictors.

::

    local_model.tableau()
    IF ISNULL([petal width]) THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]>1.75 AND ISNULL([petal length]) THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]>1.75 AND [petal length]>4.85 THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]>1.75 AND [petal length]<=4.85 AND ISNULL([sepal width]) THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]>1.75 AND [petal length]<=4.85 AND [sepal width]>3.1 THEN 'Iris-versicolor'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]>1.75 AND [petal length]<=4.85 AND [sepal width]<=3.1 THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]<=1.75 AND ISNULL([petal length]) THEN 'Iris-versicolor'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]<=1.75 AND [petal length]>4.95 AND [petal width]>1.55 AND [petal length]>5.45 THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]<=1.75 AND [petal length]>4.95 AND [petal width]>1.55 AND [petal length]<=5.45 THEN 'Iris-versicolor'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]<=1.75 AND [petal length]>4.95 AND [petal width]<=1.55 THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]<=1.75 AND [petal length]<=4.95 AND [petal width]>1.65 THEN 'Iris-virginica'
    ELSEIF [petal width]>0.8 AND [petal width]<=1.75 AND [petal length]<=4.95 AND [petal width]<=1.65 THEN 'Iris-versicolor'
    ELSEIF [petal width]<=0.8 THEN 'Iris-setosa'
    END


Summary generation
------------------

You can also print the model from the point of view of the classes it predicts
with ``local_model.summarize()``.
It shows a header section with the training data initial distribution per class
(instances and percentage) and the final predicted distribution per class.

Then each class distribution is detailed. First a header section
shows the percentage of the total data that belongs to the class (in the
training set and in the predicted results) and the rules applicable to
all the
the instances of that class (if any). Just after that, a detail section shows
each of the leaves in which the class members are distributed.
They are sorted in descending
order by the percentage of predictions of the class that fall into that leaf
and also show the full rule chain that leads to it.

::

    Data distribution:
        Iris-setosa: 33.33% (50 instances)
        Iris-versicolor: 33.33% (50 instances)
        Iris-virginica: 33.33% (50 instances)


    Predicted distribution:
        Iris-setosa: 33.33% (50 instances)
        Iris-versicolor: 33.33% (50 instances)
        Iris-virginica: 33.33% (50 instances)


    Field importance:
        1. petal length: 53.16%
        2. petal width: 46.33%
        3. sepal length: 0.51%
        4. sepal width: 0.00%


    Iris-setosa : (data 33.33% / prediction 33.33%) petal length <= 2.45
        · 100.00%: petal length <= 2.45 [Confidence: 92.86%]


    Iris-versicolor : (data 33.33% / prediction 33.33%) petal length > 2.45
        · 94.00%: petal length > 2.45 and petal width <= 1.65 and petal length <= 4.95 [Confidence: 92.44%]
        · 2.00%: petal length > 2.45 and petal width <= 1.65 and petal length > 4.95 and sepal length <= 6.05 and petal width > 1.55 [Confidence: 20.65%]

    Iris-virginica : (data 33.33% / prediction 33.33%) petal length > 2.45
        · 76.00%: petal length > 2.45 and petal width > 1.65 and petal length > 5.05 [Confidence: 90.82%]
        · 12.00%: petal length > 2.45 and petal width > 1.65 and petal length <= 5.05 and sepal width <= 2.9 [Confidence: 60.97%]

        · 2.00%: petal length > 2.45 and petal width <= 1.65 and petal length > 4.95 and sepal length <= 6.05 and petal width <= 1.55 [Confidence: 20.65%]


You can also use ``local_model.get_data_distribution()`` and
``local_model.get_prediction_distribution()`` to obtain the training and
prediction basic distribution
information as a list (suitable to draw histograms or any further processing).

Local ensembles have a ``local_ensemble.summarize()`` method too, the output
in this case shows only the data distribution and field importance sections.

Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests you will need to install
`lettuce <http://packages.python.org/lettuce/tutorial/simple.html>`_::

    $ pip install lettuce

and set up your authentication via environment variables, as explained
above. With that in place, you can run the test suite simply by::

    $ cd tests
    $ lettuce

Some tests need the `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and
`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ libraries to be installed too. They are not
automatically installed as a dependency, as they are quite heavy and very
seldom used.

Additionally, `Tox <http://tox.testrun.org/>`_ can be used to
automatically run the test suite in virtual environments for all
supported Python versions.  To install Tox::

    $ pip install tox

Then run the tests from the top-level project directory::

    $ tox

Note that tox checks the exit status from the test command (lettuce) to
determine pass/fail, but the latest version of lettuce (0.2.5)
erroneously exits with a non-zero exit status indicating an error. So,
tox will report failures even if the test suite is passing. This
`should be fixed <https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce/pull/270>`_
in the next release of lettuce.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

Install the tools required to build the documentation::

    $ pip install sphinx

To build the HTML version of the documentation::

    $ cd docs/
    $ make html

Then launch ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in your browser.

Additional Information
----------------------

For additional information about the API, see the
`BigML developer's documentation <https://bigml.com/developers>`_.
