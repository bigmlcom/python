                Given I create a whizzml library from a excerpt of code "<source_code>"

                And I update the library with "<param>", "<param_value>"

                Then the library code is "<source_code>" and the value of "<param>" is "<param_value>"

                | source_code                      | time_1  | time_2  | param | param_value
